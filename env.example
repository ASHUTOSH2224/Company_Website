# Groq API Configuration
# Sign up at https://console.groq.com/ to get your API key
# This enables the AI chatbot to use real Groq AI instead of simulated responses
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Go to https://console.groq.com/
# 2. Create an account or sign in
# 3. Navigate to API Keys section
# 4. Create a new API key
# 5. Copy the key and replace 'your_groq_api_key_here' above
# 6. Save this file as .env.local (not .env.example)
# 7. Restart your development server

# Note: The chatbot will work with simulated responses even without the API key
# But having the real API provides much better, dynamic AI responses
